# Contra

[Contra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_(video_game)) is a clone of the popular game published by Konami in 1988. The game, programmed with OpenGL graphics library, C++ and using Visual Studio 2015 as an IDE for the project, features three different levels. The first two are [Stage 1 - Jungle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xITbEpWr75k) and [Stage 2 - Base 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mWZlNOzdv8&t=1m24s). The third level uses the image of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSctBFMzP9E) final boss, but with slightly different game mechanics.
